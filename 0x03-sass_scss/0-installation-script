Steps I used to install SASS:

1. Navigated to the project folder:
  - Opened Command Prompt.
  - Went to Desktop: cd C:\Users\user\Desktop
  - Entered the project folder: cd alx-intermediate-frontend

2. Created a folder for the SASS task:
  - mkdir 0x03-sass_scss
  - cd 0x03-sass_scss

3. Tried to install the version requested by the project:
  - Ran: npm install sass@3.7.4
  - Got an error: No matching version found for sass@3.7.4
  - Learned that version 3.7.4 does not exist.

4. Installed the latest stable version of SASS:
  - Ran: npm install sass
  - SASS installed successfully.

5. Verified the installation:
  - Ran: npx sass --version
  - Output: 1.92.1 compiled with dart2js 3.9.2

6. Created a file to document the steps:
  - type nul > 0-installation-script
  - Opened the file in Notepad or VS Code.
  - Wrote all the steps above into the file and saved it.

7. Task complete:
  - Folder `0x03-sass_scss` exists.
  - SASS installed and working.
  - Installation steps documented in `0-installation-script`.
